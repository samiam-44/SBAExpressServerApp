----------APP explained
My app is a zombieish horror RPG sort of story game you get to pick your outcome
The story is AI generated but i pieced it all together in the app so it works. The process took hours.
The user can input their name and the name of the cat companion as well as delete their choices that are being recorded. There are a few more things i want to add like the styling is super simple and I wanted the intro to not display after user hits a start or next button. It definitly a project i want to come back to

I changed my mind a lot so I feel like there is a ton of code in there that needs to be cleaned up but I did run out of time so this the best i could do. Putting togther a working story was probably the hardest part of this whole project. So its definitely not the best. I think a good RPG needs to be pretty massive and this one is really short and abrupt.

I did simple CSS i wanted to go back and edit the font and add pictures and maybe background music. 

And lastly my HTML is saying working tree next to it and the format is weird Im not one hundred percet sure what thats about.
