  <h1>Adventure Game</h1>
  <p> Seattle, Washington. October 17, 2025. Day One.**  
    You were supposed to be heading to work. Just another gray morning in the Pacific Northwest. But the emergency alerts started pinging before you even got your boots on. Something about violent outbreaks... people attacking each other… hospitals overwhelmed. You thought it was another flu scare—until the screams started echoing outside your apartment.  </p>
    
   <p> You’re ex-military, discharged two years ago. You’ve seen chaos before, but nothing like this. </p>
   <p> Now you're barricaded inside with your only companion, your cat NEO, heart racing as the city descends into madness. The streets are crawling with chaos, and sirens have already gone silent. Whatever this is, it’s not going away. You’ll have to move. Fight. Survive.  </p>
    
   <p> The world you knew ended this morning.  
    What happens next... is up to you.</p>
